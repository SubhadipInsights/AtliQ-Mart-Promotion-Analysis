## üîé Project Overview 

This project focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of festive promotions executed by **AtliQ Mart** during **Diwali 2023** and **Sankranti 2024**.  

The analysis leveraged sales data to evaluate the performance of various promotional strategies‚Äîincluding **percentage discounts, cashback offers, and Buy-One-Get-One (BOGOF)** schemes‚Äîand measured their impact on:  
- Sales uplift  
- Incremental Revenue (IR)  
- Incremental Revenue % (IR%)  
- Incremental Sold Units (ISU)  
- ISU %  

An **interactive Power BI dashboard** was developed to present insights at both **promotion-level** and **store-level**, showcasing top-performing campaigns, underperforming offers, and regional variations. These insights provide the Sales Director with actionable intelligence to design more effective future promotions and optimize business outcomes through **data-driven strategies**.

## üìù Problem Statement 

AtliQ Mart launched multiple **festive promotional campaigns** during **Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024** across all stores.  

Promotions included:  
- **Percentage discounts**  
- **Cashback offers**  
- **Buy-One-Get-One (BOGOF) deals**  

While the campaigns generated a surge in sales activity, the Sales Director faces a critical challenge:  

‚û°Ô∏è Identifying which promotions were truly effective in driving **Incremental Revenue, ISU, ISU %,**  and which underperformed despite customer traffic.  

The required analysis spans three dimensions:  

1. **Store Performance** ‚Äì Evaluate top & bottom stores based on IR, ISU, and ISU %, and identify regional trends.  
2. **Promotion Type Effectiveness** ‚Äì Compare different promotion types to find which delivered maximum sales impact.  
3. **Product & Category Performance** ‚Äì Determine which products/categories responded best and correlate effectiveness with promotion type.  

This analysis will enable **data-driven decisions** for future campaigns, optimize **promotional spending**, and replicate **successful strategies** to maximize IR%, ISU, and customer engagement.

 Specific stores like STVSK-3, STCHE-1, STHYD-1 contributed ISU% below the campaign average (70%).<br>
-Regional Trend:
 Metro cities outperformed smaller markets, showing urban customers are more promotion-sensitive, especially towards Cashback and BOGOF offers.

## üéØ Recommended Action

‚Ä¢	Scale up Cashback & BOGOF promotions across all metro stores, as they consistently delivered the strongest uplift in both revenue and units sold.<br>
‚Ä¢	Reduce or phase out deep discount campaigns (25% & 50% OFF) since they eroded margins and failed to generate meaningful sales uplift.<br>
‚Ä¢	Replicate the success of Combo1 bundles & Home Appliances promotions by expanding bundled deals and high-ticket product promotions in future campaigns.<br>
‚Ä¢	Prioritize metro markets (Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad) for aggressive festive campaigns, while redesigning localized strategies for underperforming tier-2 cities.<br>
‚Ä¢	Reposition Personal Care promotions by exploring bundled offers or cross-category promotions to improve sales in this weak-performing segment.<br>
