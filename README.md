## 📝 Problem Statement 

AtliQ Mart launched multiple **festive promotional campaigns** during **Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024** across all stores.  

Promotions included:  
- **Percentage discounts**  
- **Cashback offers**  
- **Buy-One-Get-One (BOGOF) deals**  

While the campaigns generated a surge in sales activity, the Sales Director faces a critical challenge:  

➡️ Identifying which promotions were truly effective in driving **Incremental Revenue, ISU, ISU %,**  and which underperformed despite customer traffic.  

The required analysis spans three dimensions:  

1. **Store Performance** – Evaluate top & bottom stores based on IR, ISU, and ISU %, and identify regional trends.  
2. **Promotion Type Effectiveness** – Compare different promotion types to find which delivered maximum sales impact.  
3. **Product & Category Performance** – Determine which products/categories responded best and correlate effectiveness with promotion type.  

This analysis will enable **data-driven decisions** for future campaigns, optimize **promotional spending**, and replicate **successful strategies** to maximize IR%, ISU, and customer engagement.
